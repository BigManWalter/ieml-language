"O:M:.+M:O:." en comments "O x M generates verbs representing six kinds of actions.\nNote the system of analogies between actions and actors: each actor is semantically connected to the action that results from an inverse multiplication: idea/know, message/say, subject/want, individual/commit, object/can, body/do. Beyond the six actions and six actors, the letters coming respectively from O\otimesM and M\otimesO can also be used to represent dialectics or symmetries of six concepts: hexads."
